# Arcade release

INTRO

## API changes

As part of the beta phase, we learned a lot about the usage of the Arcade editor. As a result, we completely rehauled the tilemap and sprite editors. Here is the a summary of the API changes. Your older games will still run but you will have to use these APIs going forward.

### Tilemap changes

TODO: descript tilemap changes

## New Sprite Editor

We've updated the sprite editor with new tools and controls. The editor will also now size itself to fit well
inside the window of your browser or the MakeCode app.

### Drawing Tools

Three new sprite drawing tools are added. They are the **Circle**, **Line**, and **Canvas Pan** tools.

### Undo and Zoom

Along with the **Undo / Redo** controls, we've now added the canvas **Zoom** control so that you can
zoom in to draw those fine details in your images.

### Image Sizer

The **Image Size** control lets you change you sprite's image to the exact width and height that you want.

## GitHub Integration

To bring in the full power of MakeCode GitHub Integration, a **GitHub** button is now present right next
to the **Save** button. Now you can have your project's changes synced to/from GitHub with just a button
click. If you haven't learned about our new GitHub integration, read about it starting with this [blog post](\blog\github-packages).

## New Look for the Simulator

To make the UI for Simulator be a bit more appealing, we've styled the buttons, rounded the corners,
and softened it's colors.
